# Event Starter Kit

Event Starter Kit (ESK from now) is born with the **[Web European Conference](http://webnextconf.eu)** by [Ugo Lattanzi](http://tostring.it) and [Simone Chiaretta](http://codeclimber.net.nz/).


The idea is to create something that helps people to organize a conference with a small effort. 
In our case, the conference is a tech conference, but of course, you can use ESK for all kind of conferences.

## Features

A good conference requires several tech stuff:

* **Launch page**;
* **Website**;
* **Blog for news**;
* **Mobile apps** (iOS, Android and Windows Phone);

### Launch page
Basically is a website where you can put some basic information about the event and the user can subscribe to the newsletter to stay updated

### Website
Is the next step after the launch page. It contains all you need for the conference like 

* Call for paper;
* Voting;
* Registration;
* Newsletter;
* Waitlist;
* Sponsor pages;
* Agenda;
* lot of other features;

Of course is a responsive website

### Blog
It's a basic blog, maybe a bit geek but really powerful. The idea is to offer a place where you can put your news about the event;

### Mobile app
In the app we are thinking to implement all you need during the event, for example session voting, agenda and so on.

## Tech stuff

### Server side code
All about API and website is built on top of [NodeJs](http://nodejs.org) so you can use ESK on both Windows or Linux.

### Hosting
Of course you can host whatever you want, but in the repository you can find also the script to deploy the website on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) just using Git.

### Database
We are using [MongoDb](mongodb.org) because is free and really powerful.

For the blog you can use for free [Github Page](https://pages.github.com/)


### Mobile Code
The app is build using [Xamarin](https://xamarin.com), so you can easily change the app and deploy your code on the mail mobile operating systems (iOS, Android and Windows Phone)

## Social integration
There are several cool service on the web that are leader for a specific function.
We think is helpful use them directly from ESK so we implemented:

* [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) (for login/registration and sharing)
* [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com) (for login/registration and sharing)
* [Github](http://github.com) (for login because we are nerd);
* [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com/) (for newsletter);
* [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) (for event registration)
* [Disqus](http://disqus.com) (for comments)
* [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/) (for presentation slides)
* [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com) (for video sessions)
* [Paypal](http://paypal.com) (for donations)

## How to use it
Unfortunately, right now ESK is not ready except for the launch page and the blog. But of course you can collaborate to complete this important and ambitious project.
